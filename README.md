# Memory Card Game
Test your memory with this memory game.
First select the board size. The higher number means more cards and harder. On the game board, there are always two identical images. Start the game by flipping a card. Then try to find another card that has the same image as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with the face down. Try to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you play. When you find a pair they are show and fix in the board and when you find all the pairs, you win.
